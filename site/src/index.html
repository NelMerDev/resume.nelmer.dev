          <h3>Serverless Resume Platform (AWS + Terraform)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Designed and provisioned a production-style serverless
              architecture using Terraform modules: S3 static hosting, API
              Gateway (HTTP), Lambda (Python), and DynamoDB.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented remote Terraform state (S3 backend + DynamoDB locking)
              to prevent concurrent state corruption and enable safe
              infrastructure changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built GitHub Actions CI pipelines for Terraform validation and
              secure frontend deployment using OIDC (no long-lived AWS
              credentials).
            </li>
            <li>
              Enforced least-privilege IAM policies and automated S3 access
              policy updates based on Cloudflare IP ranges.
            </li>
            <li>
              Separated frontend and infrastructure repositories to mirror
              real-world DevOps team practices.
            </li>
